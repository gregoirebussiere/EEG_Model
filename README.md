# EEG_Model

Report and codes used during my summer internship in the CIDLAB with Joachim Vandekerckhove.

## There are all the different codes used during the project, even obsolete ones (mention is made in the head of the .m)

## You need to have the file "s112_ses1_sfinal.mat" from M.Nunez in your repository in order to replicate the results.

### You can contact me at bussiere@ensta.fr for any question

### Good luck for your project!
